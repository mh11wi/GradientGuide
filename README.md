# GradientGuide
This application is a tool to help plan a gradient manicure.

Start by choosing your nail shape, then up to 8 polish colors, and finally the type of gradient you wish to achieve (e.g. linear or radial).

The polishes will be applied one after the other, in the same order as selected, and evenly spaced on the nail.
